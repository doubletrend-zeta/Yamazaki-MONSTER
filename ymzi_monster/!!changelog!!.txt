10/25/20 - 70%
Tweaked
- fixed hypers not refreshing bar drain anim
- if round ends on drain, the next round will drain. If it ends on regen, the next round will regen; moreover, the bar will regen during the intro after the first round. This is more in line with source.
- Fixed helper screen move bug
- damage and percent appear when in grab (still one bug with the tens and percent, but otherwise fine)
- (do this) caught a bug where bar doesn't refill after round 2
